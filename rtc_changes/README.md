# RTC Weekly Changes

## RTC query and spreadsheet generation 

Among RTC work items there's a specific type that describes requisition changes, following a long and well-defined flow.
It's important to follow these items to prepare the groundwork for the needed development.

This script searches for every change requisition that are expected to be executed the running week and creates a list/spreadsheet for ease of management.
